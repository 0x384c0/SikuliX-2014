SikuliX-2014 (current version 1.1.0)
============

This Maven multi-module setup contains everything to <br />
**build the ready-to-use packages [available on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/sikuli)** <br />(this is at least the intention at time of final release end January 2014).

**Forking and/or downloading this repo only makes sense:** 
 - if you want to get a knowledge about the internals of Sikuli
 - if you want to create your own packages containing Sikuli features 
 - if you want to contribute.

Even if you want to develop in Java or any Java aware scripting language (Jython, JRuby, Scala. Closure, ...) it is strongly recommended to start with sikuli-java.jar, that you get when running Sikuli setup with option 4.

**To get the ready-to-use packages (IDE, Script, Java/Jython support) it is still recommended [to start here](http://www.sikuli.org/download.html).**
