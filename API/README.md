Sikuli API 2014 (version 1.1.x)
===

The Java implementation comprising the API to access the top elements (Screen, Region, Pattern, Match, Image, ...) and their methods allowing to search for images and to act on points and matches simulating mouse and keyboard.

The base package `sikuli-java.jar` provides this API for Java programming and any Java aware scripting languages (currently with some special support for Jython).

The convenience package `sikuli-script.jar` comes with the bundled Jython interpreter, thus allowing to run Sikuli scripts out of the box from the commandline and providing an interactive Sikuli aware Jython shell.<br />
This package will vanish in the long range, since it is fully contained in the IDE package.
